    One day He got bored of reigning over the earth and that's why He imprisoned the 
daemons in the cave and fettered them deadly with rusty chains. There were only two daemons 
and their names were Wrath and Idleness.
     Idleness presented a crimson-coloured monster with the body of an armadillo the size of a 
lion; but it had a very special head: it looked like a lily's flower, and its huge 'petals' were 
covered with a thick shell. In the middle of the flower' there was a mouth presenting a number 
of concentric circles of teeth, rotating in different directions. Idleness's mouth was always open 
and the teeth were slowly moving round. Luckily or not, but nothing could get into it.
     Wrath had a more human-like look. That was a brawny 20 metres tall giant with bluish 
skin. His eyes were shining blindly white, he had no hair. He wore only a loincloth. Formerly, 
before He got bored of everything, Wrath had been holding the sky, as if the ancient Atlas.
     Idleness and Wrath were not able to speak, but they often sent dreams to each other.
     But when He imprisoned the daemons in the cave, the dead left their graves and began 
wandering across the earth. The living didn't like it and that's why they grew congealed. And the 
dead were still rambling...
     Once they saw Him. He was sitting on a stone, His face was grimaced, His body was 
bending forward from time to time, with his mouth open, as if He was trying to vomit. But He 
didn't succeed. The dead decided to pass by. Only from a distance one of them took a lookback 
and saw that next to Him there grew a vine. He was watching it and smiling.
     The dead had made a long way before they came upon a cave, wherefrom a very gentle 
breeze was blowing, and they walked into. There they saw the daemons Idleness and Wrath, 
fettered to the walls with rusty chains. The dead felt pity for the daemons. They wanted to break 
them free. But they couldn't cut the chains. Then the billions of dead men simultaneously made 
such a loud bawl that the cave began breaking down. Finally, the crannies reached the fastenings 
of the daemons' chains. Idleness and Wrath got free. But the collapsing cave buried all the dead 
men under its ruins.
     Then Wrath raised his arms over the head and got down to holding the sky anew. 
Meantime, Idleness went to see Him.
     He was still sitting on the stone and watching the vine with a childish delight. When 
Idleness came up, He broke off contemplating His creation and looked into the daemon�s mouth. 
It was open, as usually, and the circle rows of teeth were moving.
     Suddenly, He stood up and threw himself into the monster�s mouth. The daemon chewed 
and swallowed Him immediately. The 'petals' around the mouth shut. Forever. Nothing will get 
into it anymore.
